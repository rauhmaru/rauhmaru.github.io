<p>openSUSE, the FOSS project near and dear to my heart is electing 3 new members to sit on its <a title="Board" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board">Board</a>, the group that has the responsibility to help guide the great ship Geeko forward.</p>
<p>I'm standing alongside a number of great candidates in the hope of being one of the 3 elected this year.</p>
<p>My full platform can be read on <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board_election_2011_platform_template_rbrownccb">my election page here</a></p>
<p>I'm excited at the idea of trying something new, taking on a new challenge, and having an opportunity to get my hands dirty helping out the best (and greenest) FOSS project out there.</p>
<p>If you're an <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Members">openSUSE Member</a> please consider me for one of your 3 votes, which you can place on our <a href="https://connect.opensuse.org//pg/polls/read/digitaltomm/15228/opensuse-board-election-2011">openSUSE Connect Election Poll</a></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who's supporting me and wish me luck for the results when the poll closes in two weeks.</p>
